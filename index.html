        <h2 id="IT">My interest in designing web pages</h2>
        <p>All started because I watched a lot of business channels in Youtube. Some channels such as <em>"Emprende Aprendiendo"</em> and <em>"Cesar Dabian"</em>. They teach the idea of solving problems to people and, this solve of problems will result eventually in money. By knowing this idea I thought in what I could do in my surroundings, and I realised that many businesses doesn't have a web page! I know the importance of having a business on ithernet and some local businesses didn't know how to put their products on ithernet o they could not even know that having a business on ithernet could raise they sells.</p>

      <p>  <br>That has been my motivation or interest of knowing how to design a web page because is something in which my surroundings should have and it is a job in which <strong>someone can work of many different things </strong>, like a bakery, a gym store, a bike store, a cosmetics store, and more!  </p>
        
        <h2 id="IIT"> My firsts impressions about Khan Academy</h2>
        
       <p> <strong>Khan Academy </strong>is a web page that teaches people many different subjects. Some subjects they teach are economy and programming, and they teach for free! </p>

        <p> I discovered Khan Academy by searching web pages that teach web development. I entered in a web page that describe the best pages for web development and the ones that are free, in the 5 web pages presented, Khan Academy was there. 
        <br> I entered and I got amazed by the perfect tools the web gives to the students! I started with basic JS, and now I am studying HTML and CSS. I am very grateful for knowing this page and I hope many people with the same interests could enter and practice what they want to learn.</p>
        
        <h2 id="IIIT"> My experience with basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS</h2>
        <p> When I searched on inthernet what I should learn to design web pages, I saw that the main languages I should know (or at least to start) are JS, HTML, and CSS. So I started to learn all of them! </p>

        <p> When I started JS I <strong>didn't know anything about it </strong>. When I started with the videos, practices, and projects I became very interested in the language because was very cool for me to see objects moving. I continued and a finished the first part of JS, so I continue now with HTML and CSS which are more important in the web development. Know, I dind't finished HTML and CSS, but I will continue until I am a professional in all this languajes. </p>
        
        <h2 id="IIIIT"> My motivation for finding more programming web pages</h2>
        
        <p>When I finished my basic training in JS, I made a little proyect in a medium range to learn more deeply this 3 languages (HTML,CSS,JS) to give my services as web developer. I passed 1 week testing and seeing if other websites are good as Khan Academy form of teaching (I just saw first impressions, not the complete tasks the other websites teach).</p>

       <p> Finally, I made a list of the best websites I saw, which were arround 10. When I finished all the topics of Khan Academy web development, I will continue with the other websites. <p>
